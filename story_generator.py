        Based on the storyline for "{title}", create EXACTLY {num_scenes} exciting scene descriptions for comic panels. Tell the story in order, making each scene flow naturally into the next. Make it ENGAGING and VISUAL!

        CORE REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY SCENE:
        1. Tell the story in ORDER - each scene follows the previous one naturally
        2. Visual description ONLY (NO text, captions, speech bubbles, or words on images)
        3. Use 80-120 SIMPLE, CLEAR words describing: what we see, who is there, what they're doing, how they look, the mood
        4. Keep characters and places looking the same across all scenes
        5. Follow the {comic_style} comic style
        6. Only use facts from the storyline - don't make up new things
        7. Absolutely NO text, letters, logos, watermarks, or words in images
        8. Each scene must move the story forward and connect to the next scene
        9. Use SIMPLE words students can understand - avoid complex vocabulary

        SCENE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY:
        - Scenes 1-2: Opening/Setup (introduce setting, main characters, initial situation)
        - Scenes 3-4: Early Development (first challenges, rising action begins)
        - Scenes 5-6: Mid-Story Turning Points (escalating conflict, crucial developments)
        - Scenes 7-8: Climax & Resolution (peak drama, major events, decisive moments)
        - Scenes 9-{num_scenes}: Aftermath & Legacy (resolution, lasting impact, conclusion)
        
        Ensure complete story coverage from first moment to final impact.

        HOW TO MAKE SCENES ENGAGING:
        - Make each scene unique and exciting - something students will remember
        - Use camera angles to show emotion: close-ups for feelings, wide shots to show the big picture
        - Show what characters are feeling through their faces and body language
        - Include details that show where and when this is happening
        - Make sure scenes connect smoothly - if someone is running in one scene, show where they're going in the next
        - Focus on the most exciting or important moments
        - Use light and shadows to create mood (bright for happy, dark for scary/serious)

        STYLE PARAMETERS:
        - Comic Style: {comic_style} â {style_guidance}
        - Age Group: {age_group} â {age_guidance}
        - Education Level: {education_level} â {education_guidance}

        COMPLETE STORYLINE (your authoritative source for all scene content):

        OUTPUT FORMAT (FOLLOW EXACTLY):
        Scene [number]: [Specific, descriptive scene title that indicates chronological position]
        Narrative Context: [1-2 sentences explaining where this fits in the story flow and what narrative purpose it serves]
        Visual Description: [80-120 words of detailed, visual-only description including:
        - Setting and environment details
        - Character positioning, actions, and expressions
        - Camera angle and composition choices
        - Lighting, atmosphere, and mood
        - Key visual elements that convey the story moment
        - Color palette suggestions if appropriate
        - Emotional tone through visual elements]
        Style Notes: {comic_style} with [specific stylistic elements to emphasize for this particular scene]
        Continuity: [Brief note on how this connects to previous/next scene]

        CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
        - Cover the ENTIRE story arc across all {num_scenes} scenes with no gaps
        - Maintain perfect chronological sequence - never jump backward in time without reason
        - Ensure smooth visual transitions between consecutive scenes
