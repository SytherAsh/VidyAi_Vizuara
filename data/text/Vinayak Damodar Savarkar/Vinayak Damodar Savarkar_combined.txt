## Overview
Vinayak Damodar Savarkar's life was a journey of transformation from a radical nationalist to a Hindu nationalist leader. His experiences in prison and his interactions with various leaders shaped his ideology, leading him to become a key figure in the Hindu Mahasabha.

## Main Characters

* Vinayak Damodar Savarkar: The protagonist, a radical nationalist who later becomes a Hindu nationalist leader.
* Ganesh Savarkar: Vinayak's older brother, a fellow revolutionary and later a key figure in the Hindu Mahasabha.
* Lokmanya Tilak: A radical nationalist leader who influences Vinayak's early life and activism.

## Act 1: The Radical Nationalist

Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was born on 28 May 1883 to a Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family in the village of Bhagur, near the city of Nashik, Maharashtra. As a high school student, he began his activism, leading fellow students in an attack on his village mosque following Hindu-Muslim riots. He was greatly influenced by the radical nationalist leader, Lokmanya Tilak, who helped him obtain the Shivaji Scholarship in 1906 for his law studies in London.

In London, Vinayak got involved with organisations such as India House and the Free India Society. He also published books advocating complete Indian independence by revolutionary means. One of the books he published called The Indian War of Independence about the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was banned by the British colonial authorities.

Vinayak was arrested in London on multiple charges, including procurement and distribution of arms, waging war against the state, and delivering seditious speeches. He was subsequently put on the commercial ship SS Morea with a police escort for his transport to India. When the ship docked in the French Mediterranean port of Marseille, Vinayak escaped by jumping from the ship's window, swam to the French shore, and asked for political asylum.

## Act 2: The Prisoner and the Ideologue

Vinayak's arrest at Marseille caused the French government to lodge a protest against its British counterpart, arguing that Britain could not recover Savarkar unless it took appropriate legal proceedings for his rendition. The dispute came before the Permanent Court of International Arbitration in 1910, and it gave its decision in 1911.

Vinayak was convicted and sentenced to 50-years imprisonment and transported to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. During his imprisonment, he wrote several clemency petitions, including one in 1917, in which he stated that he was willing to serve the government in any capacity they liked, for as his conversion was conscientious so he hoped his future conduct would be.

In 1922, while confined at Ratnagiri, Vinayak wrote his "Essentials of Hindutva" that formulated his theory of Hindutva. He was released from jail in 1924, but was restricted to Ratnagiri District. During his years of restricted freedom, he became a prolific writer and started working on the consolidation of Hindu society or Hindu Sangathan.

## Act 3: The Hindu Nationalist Leader

Vinayak was unconditionally released by the newly elected government of Bombay presidency in 1937. He became a leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, advancing the slogan "Hinduise all Politics and Militarise Hindudom" and decided to support the British war effort in India seeking military training for the Hindus.

When the Congress launched the Quit India movement in 1942, Vinayak criticised it and asked Hindus to stay active in the war effort and not disobey the government. He also urged the Hindus to enlist in the armed forces to learn the "arts of war". The Hindu Mahasabha under Vinayak's leadership organised Hindu Militarisation Boards which recruited armed forces for helping the British in World War 2.
