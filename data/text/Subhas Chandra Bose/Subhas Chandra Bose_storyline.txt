## Act 1: "The Making of a Nationalist"

In the early 20th century, Subhas Chandra Bose is born into a wealthy Bengali family in Orissa, India. He receives an education oriented towards British standards and is sent to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. However, Bose becomes disillusioned with the British Raj and decides not to proceed with the final exam. He returns to India in 1921 and joins the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress.

As Bose becomes more involved in the movement, he meets C. R. Das, a lawyer and politician who encourages him to return to Calcutta and become involved in nationalist politics. Bose becomes the editor of the newspaper "Forward" and works as the CEO of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for Das.

However, Bose's activism attracts the attention of the British authorities, and he is arrested and imprisoned in Mandalay, British Burma, where he contracts tuberculosis.

## Act 2: "The Rise of a Leader"

After being released from prison in 1927, Bose becomes general secretary of the Congress party and works with Jawaharlal Nehru for independence. He organizes the Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta and becomes the general officer commanding (GOC) Congress Volunteer Corps.

Bose's charisma and leadership skills make him a popular figure in the nationalist movement, and he becomes a key player in the Indian National Congress. However, his differences with Gandhi on the question of means and ends create tension within the movement.

In 1938, Bose becomes president of the Indian National Congress, but his leadership style and ideology create divisions within the party. He is eventually ousted from the party, but he continues to work towards Indian independence.

## Act 3: "The Axis Alliance"

In 1941, Bose arrives in Nazi Germany, where he meets with Adolf Hitler and forms an alliance with the Axis powers. He establishes a Free India Centre in Berlin and recruits a 3,000-strong Free India Legion from among Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps.

Bose's alliance with the Axis powers is a turning point in his career, and he becomes a key figure in the Indian National Army (INA). He declares a Provisional Government of Free India (Azad Hind) on the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands and becomes its nominal president.

However, Bose's military efforts are short-lived, and the British Indian Army reverses the Japanese attack on India. The INA is driven down the Malay Peninsula and surrenders with the recapture of Singapore.
