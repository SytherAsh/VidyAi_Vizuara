## Act 1: The Beginning - Early Life and Struggles
Sambhaji was born on May 14, 1657, to Shivaji and his first wife, Saibai. At the age of nine, he was taken as a political hostage by the Mughal Empire to ensure his father's compliance with the Treaty of Purandar. This early experience shaped Sambhaji's perception of the Mughals and his future actions. Sambhaji's relationship with his father was complex, with periods of estrangement, including his imprisonment at Panhala Fort, allegedly due to his addiction to sensual pleasures or an attempt to violate a Brahmin woman. This act sets the stage for Sambhaji's personal and political conflicts.

## Act 2: Rising Action - Ascension to the Throne
Following Shivaji's death in 1680, Sambhaji faced opposition from his stepmother, Soyarabai, and other ministers who sought to install his half-brother, Rajaram, as the king. Sambhaji plotted his escape from Panhala Fort, took control of Raigad Fort, and formally ascended the throne on July 20, 1680. This act marked the beginning of Sambhaji's reign, characterized by his military campaigns against the Mughals and other neighboring powers. Sambhaji's early successes, including the execution of conspirators and the continuation of his father's administrative systems, were overshadowed by his personal problems and the atrocities committed by his soldiers.

## Act 3: Turning Point - Military Campaigns and Defeats
Sambhaji's military campaigns, including the attack on Burhanpur and the granting of refuge to Prince Akbar, led to a significant escalation of the conflict with the Mughal Empire. Despite initial successes, such as the repulsion of the Mughal invasion of Konkan in 1684, Sambhaji faced numerous challenges, including the defection of Maratha deshmukhs and the failure to capture key forts like Janjira. The turning point came with the Mughal invasions of Konkan, which, although repelled, marked the beginning of a series of setbacks for Sambhaji, including the Battle of Wai in 1687, where a key Maratha commander was killed, and troops began to desert.

## Act 4: Climax & Resolution - Capture, Torture, and Execution
In February 1689, Sambhaji was captured by the Mughal forces of Muqarrab Khan. He was taken to the fort of Bahadurgad, where he was subjected to humiliation, torture, and eventually executed on March 11, 1689, for his refusal to surrender his forts and treasures and for insulting the Mughal Emperor and the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Sambhaji's death marked a significant turning point in the Mughal-Maratha wars, with his brother Rajaram succeeding him and continuing the conflict.

## Act 5: Lasting Impact & Legacy - Aftermath and Remembrance
Sambhaji's execution had a profound impact on the Maratha Empire, leading to a period of disarray and the eventual shift of the capital to Jinji. However, his death also galvanized the Marathas, who continued to fight against the Mughal Empire under the leadership of Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav. Sambhaji's legacy is complex, with historians viewing him poorly due to his personal problems and the atrocities committed during his reign. However, he is also remembered as a martyr who fought against the Mughal Empire, and his story has become emblematic of the struggle for Hindu self-rule.
