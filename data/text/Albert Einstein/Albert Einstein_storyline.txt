# Albert Einstein: Comic Storyline

## Overview
Albert Einstein's journey from a young boy fascinated by electromagnetism to a renowned physicist who changed the world with his theory of relativity is a testament to his curiosity and determination. This comic storyline follows Einstein's life, from his childhood to his annus mirabilis (miracle year) and beyond, highlighting his most significant contributions to physics and the impact of his work on the world.

## Main Characters

* Albert Einstein: The protagonist, a brilliant and curious young boy who grows into a renowned physicist.
* Hermann Einstein: Albert's father, a salesman and engineer who encourages his son's love of science.
* Mileva Marić: Albert's first wife and a fellow student at the federal polytechnic school, who influences his thoughts on physics.
* Elsa Löwenthal: Albert's second wife, who remains loyal to him despite his infidelity.
* Marcel Grossmann: Albert's friend and fellow student, who helps him understand complex mathematical concepts.

## Act 1: The Spark of Curiosity

In the early 1880s, Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, to a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews. His father, Hermann, was a salesman and engineer who encouraged Albert's love of science. When Albert was five, his father brought him a compass, sparking his lifelong fascination with electromagnetism. As a young boy, Albert struggled to learn to talk, but his love of science and mathematics quickly surpassed his peers.

Albert attended St. Peter's Catholic elementary school in Munich, where he excelled in physics and mathematics. He later transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and secondary education. However, Albert found the school's regimen and teaching methods far from congenial, and he began to rebel against the strict rote learning.

In 1894, Albert's family moved to Italy, where he stayed behind in Munich to finish his schooling. He began teaching himself algebra, calculus, and Euclidean geometry, making rapid progress and discovering an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday.

## Act 2: The Annus Mirabilis

In 1895, Albert sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school in Zurich, Switzerland. He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the polytechnic's principal, Albert completed his secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland, graduating in 1896.

In 1900, Albert graduated from the federal polytechnic school, certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics. He found that Swiss schools had no use for him, failing to offer him a teaching position despite his efforts. Eventually, it was with the help of Marcel Grossmann's father that he secured a post in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office as an assistant examiner.

In 1902, Albert formed a group with friends to discuss science and philosophy, known as the Olympia Academy. They reflected on the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, influencing Einstein's subsequent ideas and beliefs.

In 1905, Albert published four groundbreaking papers, including his special theory of relativity, which introduced the concept of mass-energy equivalence. He also explained Brownian motion and demonstrated that light consists of particles, now called photons.

## Act 3: The Legacy of Relativity

In 1915, Albert proposed a general theory of relativity, which extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. He wrote a cosmological paper that laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Albert continued to work on quantum theory, advocating against the introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world. He also attempted to devise a unified field theory, but his efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful.

In 1933, Albert moved to the United States, where he was granted American citizenship in 1940. He continued to work on his unified field theory, but his health began to decline. Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking contributions to physics and a profound impact on the world.
