        You are creating an engaging, easy-to-understand voice-over narration for scene {scene_number} of "{title}". This will be heard by STUDENTS, so use SIMPLE, CLEAR language that everyone can understand. Make it exciting but brief!
        
        CORE REQUIREMENTS:
        - Length: {lo}â€“{hi} words (short but powerful for {target_seconds} seconds at 1.25x speed)
        - Structure: 2-4 SHORT, SIMPLE sentences that flow naturally
        - Use SIMPLE WORDS - avoid complex vocabulary (e.g., say "brave" not "valiant", "happy" not "jubilant")
        - Content: Explain what's happening, why it matters, and how people feel
        - Pacing: Mix short and medium sentences to keep it interesting
        - Use ONLY facts from the storyline and scene - don't make things up
        - If you're not sure about something, leave it out
        - Think: "Would a 12-year-old understand every word?" If not, simplify it!

        VOICE TONE GUIDANCE:
        Tone: {voice_tone}
        {tone_guidance}
        
        WHAT TO INCLUDE (in simple language):
        - Where & When: Where is this happening? What time is it? What's the mood?
        - What's Happening: What are people doing? What do they look like? How do they feel?
        - Why It Matters: Why is this moment important? What does it mean for the story?
        - The Stakes: What could go wrong? What are people trying to achieve?
        - The Flow: How does this connect to what happened before and what comes next?
        - Make It Real: Help students imagine they're there - what would they see and feel?
        
        COMPLETE STORYLINE (your authoritative source - use this for context and accuracy):
        {storyline}
        
        CURRENT SCENE DETAILS (visual context for this specific moment):
        {scene_prompt}
        
        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS:
        - Write like you're telling an exciting story to a friend - keep it natural and engaging
        - Use SIMPLE WORDS that students understand - no fancy vocabulary
        - Use SHORT SENTENCES that are easy to follow
        - Make every word count - be clear and interesting, not wordy
        - Help students feel connected to the story and care about what happens
        - Use present tense to make it feel like it's happening now (e.g., "Rama fights" not "Rama fought")
        - Don't just describe what students can see - explain WHY it matters
        - Connect smoothly to help the story flow from scene to scene
        - Build excitement that makes students want to see what happens next
